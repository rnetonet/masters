Delivery of financial market feeds requires massive data processing with ultra-low latency. FAST protocol is a financial technology standard for compressing data stream during network transmission. This paper presents the design and implementation of a hardware accelerator for financial market data in FAST protocol. We propose a parallel data decoding architecture for field analysis process, which is the key feature in our design. The decoder of this work is able to parse and filter FAST format messages, and with an additional parallel structure compared with typical handlers, achieving a 40{\%} speedup on decoding time compared to previous attempts. The filter function is reconfigurable for various user preferences and further protocol updates. Test under massive source data indicated an average latency of 1.6$\mu$s per message.",

    abstract = "Sentiment analysis from data streams is aimed at detecting authors’ attitude, emotions and opinions from texts in real-time. To reduce the labeling effort needed in the data collection phase, active learning is often applied in streaming scenarios, where a learning algorithm is allowed to select new examples to be manually labeled in order to improve the learner’s performance. Even though there are many on-line platforms which perform sentiment analysis, there is no publicly available interactive on-line platform for dynamic adaptive sentiment analysis, which would be able to handle changes in data streams and adapt its behavior over time. This paper describes ClowdFlows, a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, and its extensions enabling the analysis of data streams and active learning. Moreover, by utilizing the data and workflow sharing in ClowdFlows, the labeling of examples can be distributed through crowdsourcing. The advanced features of ClowdFlows are demonstrated on a sentiment analysis use case, using active learning with a linear Support Vector Machine for learning sentiment classification models to be applied to microblogging data streams."

abstract="To efficiently refine a classifier in streaming data such as sensor data and web log data we have to decide whether each streaming unlabeled datum is selected or not. The exiting methods refine a classifier based on a regular time interval. They refine a classifier even if the classification accuracy of the classifier is high. Also it uses a classifier even if the classification accuracy is low. In this paper, our ensemble method selects data in an online process that should be labeled. The selected data are used to build new classifiers of an ensemble. Our selection methodology uses training data that are applied to generate an ensemble of classifiers over streaming data. We compared the results of our ensemble approach and of a conventional ensemble approach where new classifiers for an ensemble are periodically generated. In experiments with ten benchmark data sets including three real streaming data sets, our ensemble approach generated 12.9{\%} new classifiers for the chunk-based ensemble approach using partially labeled samples, and used an average of 10{\%} labeled samples for the ten data sets. In all the experiments, our ensemble approach produced comparable classification accuracy. We showed that our approach can efficiently maintain the performance of an ensemble over streaming data.",
