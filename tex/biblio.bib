We propose a new algorithm called Accuracy Updated Ensemble (AUE), which extends AWE by using online component classifiers and updating them according to the current distribution. Additional modifications of weighting functions solve problems with undesired classifier excluding seen in AWE. Experiments with several evolving data sets show that, while still requiring constant processing time and memory, AUE is more accurate than AWE.",

abstract="This paper describes experimental results on using Winnow and Weighted-Majority based algorithms on a real-world calendar scheduling domain. These two algorithms have been highly studied in the theoretical machine learning literature. We show here that these algorithms can be quite competitive practically, outperforming the decision-tree approach currently in use in the Calendar Apprentice system in terms of both accuracy and speed. One of the contributions of this paper is a new variant on the Winnow algorithm (used in the experiments) that is especially suited to conditions with string-valued classifications, and we give a theoretical analysis of its performance. In addition we show how Winnow can be applied to achieve a good accuracy/coverage tradeoff and explore issues that arise such as concept drift. We also provide an analysis of a policy for discarding predictors in Weighted-Majority that allows it to speed up as it learns.",

abstract="To efficiently refine a classifier in streaming data such as sensor data and web log data we have to decide whether each streaming unlabeled datum is selected or not. The exiting methods refine a classifier based on a regular time interval. They refine a classifier even if the classification accuracy of the classifier is high. Also it uses a classifier even if the classification accuracy is low. In this paper, our ensemble method selects data in an online process that should be labeled. The selected data are used to build new classifiers of an ensemble. Our selection methodology uses training data that are applied to generate an ensemble of classifiers over streaming data. We compared the results of our ensemble approach and of a conventional ensemble approach where new classifiers for an ensemble are periodically generated. In experiments with ten benchmark data sets including three real streaming data sets, our ensemble approach generated 12.9{\%} new classifiers for the chunk-based ensemble approach using partially labeled samples, and used an average of 10{\%} labeled samples for the ten data sets. In all the experiments, our ensemble approach produced comparable classification accuracy. We showed that our approach can efficiently maintain the performance of an ensemble over streaming data.",
