We propose a new algorithm called Accuracy Updated Ensemble (AUE), which extends AWE by using online component classifiers and updating them according to the current distribution. Additional modifications of weighting functions solve problems with undesired classifier excluding seen in AWE. Experiments with several evolving data sets show that, while still requiring constant processing time and memory, AUE is more accurate than AWE.",

These two algorithms have been highly studied in the theoretical machine learning literature. We show here that these algorithms can be quite competitive practically, outperforming the decision-tree approach currently in use in the Calendar Apprentice system in terms of both accuracy and speed. One of the contributions of this paper is a new variant on the Winnow algorithm (used in the experiments) that is especially suited to conditions with string-valued classifications, and we give a theoretical analysis of its performance. In addition we show how Winnow can be applied to achieve a good accuracy/coverage tradeoff and explore issues that arise such as concept drift. We also provide an analysis of a policy for discarding predictors in Weighted-Majority that allows it to speed up as it learns.",

abstract="To efficiently refine a classifier in streaming data such as sensor data and web log data we have to decide whether each streaming unlabeled datum is selected or not. The exiting methods refine a classifier based on a regular time interval. They refine a classifier even if the classification accuracy of the classifier is high. Also it uses a classifier even if the classification accuracy is low. In this paper, our ensemble method selects data in an online process that should be labeled. The selected data are used to build new classifiers of an ensemble. Our selection methodology uses training data that are applied to generate an ensemble of classifiers over streaming data. We compared the results of our ensemble approach and of a conventional ensemble approach where new classifiers for an ensemble are periodically generated. In experiments with ten benchmark data sets including three real streaming data sets, our ensemble approach generated 12.9{\%} new classifiers for the chunk-based ensemble approach using partially labeled samples, and used an average of 10{\%} labeled samples for the ten data sets. In all the experiments, our ensemble approach produced comparable classification accuracy. We showed that our approach can efficiently maintain the performance of an ensemble over streaming data.",

    abstract="Induction of a concept description given noisy instances is difficult and is further exacerbated when the concepts may change over time. This paper presents a solution which has been guided by psychological and mathematical results. The method is based on a distributed concept description which is composed of a set of weighted, symbolic characterizations. Two learning processes incrementally modify this description. One adjusts the characterization weights and another creates new characterizations. The latter process is described in terms of a search through the space of possibilities and is shown to require linear space with respect to the number of attribute-value pairs in the description language. The method utilizes previously acquired concept definitions in subsequent learning by adding an attribute for each learned concept to instance descriptions. A program called STAGGER fully embodies this method, and this paper reports on a number of empirical analyses of its performance. Since understanding the relationships between a new learning method and existing ones can be difficult, this paper first reviews a framework for discussing machine learning systems and then describes STAGGER in that framework.",

This paper evaluates eight different concept drift detectors (ddm, eddm, pht, stepd, dof, adwin, Paired Learners, and ecdd) and performs tests using artificial datasets affected by abrupt and gradual concept drifts, with several rates of drift, with and without noise and irrelevant attributes, and also using real-world datasets. In addition, a 2k factorial design was used to indicate the parameters that most influence performance which is a novelty in the area. Also, a variation of the Friedman non-parametric statistical test was used to identify the best methods. Experiments compared accuracy, evaluation time, as well as false alarm and miss detection rates. Additionally, we used the Mahalanobis distance to measure how similar the methods are when compared to the best possible detection output. This work can, to some extent, also be seen as a research survey of existing drift detection methods."

    abstract="A text-dependent speaker recognition system base on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network is presented. A two-stage recognition approach is proposed, in which the speaker-cohort model and the gender model are integrated to give the decision. The speaker recognition system has been evaluated in terms of both speaker verification and closed-set speaker identification. The results clearly indicate that the two-stage procedure is able to improve the overall performance of the speaker recognition system.",
